# Face-Mask-Detection

Successfully trained a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks which can predict to a great level of accuracy whether a given person is wearing a mask or not.

## Dataset Used

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset

## Context

This dataset is used for Face Mask Detection Classification with images. The dataset consists of almost 12K images which are almost 328.92MB in size.

## Technologies Used

<ul>
  <li>Keras</li>
  <li>Tensorflow</li>
  <li>Scikit-learn</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
</ul>

## Acknowledgments

All the images with the face mask (~6K) are scrapped from google search and all the images without the face mask are preprocessed from the CelebFace dataset created by Jessica Li. Thank you so much Jessica for providing a wonderful dataset to the community.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind creating this dataset is to create an algorithm that can directly detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not. So the images have been scraped from Google as well as from the CelebFace dataset created by Jessica Li to make this happen.
